I am an MSc student in the [Erasmus Mundus Joint Master of Science in Imaging and Light in Extended Reality (IMLEX)](https://www.imlex.org/), specializing in Imaging, Color Science, and Extended Reality (XR). My academic journey is rooted in Computer Science and Psychophysics, with a particular focus on the intersection of human perception and art.

Previously, I worked two years at [Dots for Inc.](https://dotsfor.com/)  as a Product Manager Intern, where I bridged the gap between technical constraints and user-centric solutions. I hold a B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Toyohashi University of Technology](https://www.tut.ac.jp/) and an A.Eng. in Electronic and Information Technology from the [National Institute of Technology, Suzuka College (KOSEN)](https://www.suzuka-ct.ac.jp/).
